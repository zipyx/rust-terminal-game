# rust-terminal-game
A simple terminal game written in Rust based on the project CleanCuts by Nathan Stocks.

The game contains `.wav` files that are used as audio tracks within the game. I've written the game based on 
vim keybindings and inspiration. 

### How to play
- `h` moves the player left
- `l` moves the player right
- `j` or `k` allows the player to shoot a target.
- `q` or `esc` quits the game

### Special keys 
- `b` plays the heroes audio track
- `s` plays the storm audio track
- `w` plays the wartime audio track

## How to run the game
Since this is a terminal game, the assumption is you have `rust` installed on your terminal and you are able to run `cargo`.

```bash
# Run the command in the parent folder
cargo run
```
